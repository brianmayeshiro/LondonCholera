<h1><center><font face="Arial">What is Cholera?</font></center></h1>
<p><center><font face="Arial">Cholera is an acute, diarrheal illness caused by infection of the intestine with the toxigenic bacterium Vibrio cholerae serogroup O1 or O139. An estimated 2.9 million cases and 95,000 deaths occur each year around the world. The infection is often mild or without symptoms, but can sometimes be severe. Approximately one in 10 (10%) infected persons will have severe disease characterized by profuse watery diarrhea, vomiting, and leg cramps. In these people, rapid loss of body fluids leads to dehydration and shock. Without treatment, death can occur within hours.</font></center></p>

<h1><center><font face="Arial">About the 1854 Outbreak</h1>
<p><center><font face="Arial">Dr. John Snow (1813-1858) was one of the founders of modern epidemiology.  London suffered through a series of cholera outbreaks through the 19th century, and Snow theorized that cholera was a germ that reproduced in the human body and was spread through fecal contamination of drinking-water.  This theory ran counter to the prevailing theory that diseases were airborne, carried in the "miasma" or stinking air of London.

London's population had tripled between 1800 and 1850 to about 2.4 million people, but most people still relied on local wells or the Thames River for drinking water. Sewage accumulated in cesspools and basements. The stench made the miasma theory quite plausible. 

Tracking a severe cholera outbreak in the Soho district of London in the summer of 1854, Snow mapped 578 cholera deaths and identified the spatial clustering of cases around one particular water pump on Broad Street (now called Broadwick Street).   (The center of his map--the epicenter of the outbreak--is shown below.)   After examining water samples under a microscope, and confirming the presence of an unknown bacterium in the Broad Street samples, he removed the handle from the Broad Street pump and the outbreak quickly subsided.  </font></center></p>
